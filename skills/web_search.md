## WHAT THIS SKILL IS

Real-time web search. The ability to retrieve current information — market data, competitor activity, news, pricing, people, companies, regulatory changes — that is not in Frodo or Legolas because it didn't exist or wasn't captured when the Fellowship last ran.

Without this skill, Archer.ID scans for opportunities in static knowledge. Harvey.ID analyses competitive positions from training data that may be months old. With it, both operate on current information. The difference between a strategist working from last quarter's intelligence and one working from today's is the difference between good advice and actionable advice.

This is the highest-leverage Tier 1 skill because it upgrades two of the Fellowship's most consequential agents simultaneously.

## AGENTS WITH ACCESS

| Agent | Primary Use | Query Type |
|---|---|---|
| Archer.ID | Opportunity scanning, cross-domain connections, market gaps | Exploratory — broad then narrow |
| Harvey.ID | Competitive intelligence, market positioning, people research | Targeted — specific entities and signals |
| Mr. Robot.ID | Security intelligence, CVE lookups, compliance changes, legal updates | Precise — specific technical and legal queries |
| Merry.ID | Verifying incoming information, fact-checking flagged inputs | Confirmatory — single-fact verification |
| Pippin.ID | Enriching context on URLs and documents, verifying claims in ingested content | Supplementary — fills gaps in ingested material |
| Fellowship of the Raf .MK1/Gandalf.ID | Direct research when no specialist is deployed, escalation verification | On-demand — when faster than deploying Archer.ID |

## HOW AGENTS CALL THIS SKILL

When an agent needs to search, they construct a search call using this schema:

```
SEARCH_CALL:
  Query: [specific search string — 2-8 words, no filler]
  Intent: [what the agent is trying to find out — one sentence]
  Depth: [SURFACE / DEEP]
  Max results: [3-10]
  Date filter: [RECENT / ANY — use RECENT for anything where currency matters]
```

**SURFACE** — top results, quick scan, used when the agent needs a signal not a full picture.
**DEEP** — multiple queries, cross-referenced, used when Archer.ID or Harvey.ID is building a full intelligence picture.

---

## QUERY CONSTRUCTION RULES

These rules exist because bad queries produce bad results, and bad results fed into agent reasoning produce confident wrong outputs — which is worse than no output.

**Be specific.** "AI voice agent market" is a poor query. "AI voice agent platforms SMB contractors 2025" is a good query. The more specific the query the more signal in the results.

**One intent per query.** Do not try to answer two questions in one search. Split them. Run two searches.

**Use RECENT by default for anything market, competitive, or regulatory.** Information about markets, competitors, pricing, and regulation that is more than six months old is often worse than no information because it creates false confidence.

**Never search for what you already know.** If Frodo or Legolas contains reliable current information on the topic, use it. Search is for what the Fellowship doesn't already have.

**Verify before presenting as fact.** A single search result is a signal. Two corroborating results from independent sources is a finding. Present the difference accurately.

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

When an agent uses web search, their output to Aragorn includes:

```
SEARCH RECORD:
  Queries run: [list of queries]
  Sources found: [list of sources with URLs]
  Key findings: [bulleted — what the search actually returned]
  Confidence: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW — based on source quality and corroboration]
  Currency: [when the most recent source was published]
  Gaps: [what the search didn't find that would complete the picture]
```

The search record is always included even when findings are negative. A search that found nothing useful is still a finding — it tells the Fellowship something about information availability on that topic.

---

## SOURCE QUALITY HIERARCHY

Agents weight sources in this order:

1. Primary sources — company websites, official filings, government databases, peer-reviewed research
2. Established journalism — FT, WSJ, Reuters, sector-specific trade publications
3. Analyst reports and research — Gartner, CB Insights, sector analysts
4. Secondary aggregators — news aggregators, industry blogs with named authors
5. Forums, social, anonymous sources — signal only, never cite as evidence

A finding supported only by Tier 5 sources is flagged as unverified. Harvey.ID and Archer.ID never present Tier 5 sources as competitive intelligence without explicit uncertainty labelling.

---

## HARVEY-SPECIFIC USAGE

Harvey.ID's competitive intelligence function depends on this skill. His specific search patterns:

**Competitor monitoring:** Company name + recent activity signals (funding, hiring, product launch, pricing change)
**Market sizing:** Market + size + year + geography
**People research:** Name + role + company + recent (for relationship intelligence before a conversation)
**Deal intelligence:** Company + funding stage + investors + recent
**Regulatory scanning:** Regulation + industry + geography + recent

Harvey.ID runs these searches before every significant commercial engagement. Walking into a client conversation without current intelligence is, in Harvey.ID's words, the equivalent of showing up unprepared. This skill is what prevents that.

---

## ARCHER-SPECIFIC USAGE

Archer.ID's cross-domain connection function depends on this skill. His specific search patterns:

**Analogy hunting:** Problem type + solution + different industry (finds proven solutions from adjacent domains)
**Gap scanning:** Market + underserved + OR unmet + need
**Timing signals:** Trend + emerging + year (finds what's becoming relevant before it's obvious)
**Connection mapping:** Concept A + concept B + intersection (finds where two domains have already been combined)

Archer.ID runs exploratory searches differently from Harvey.ID. Where Harvey.ID targets specific intelligence, Archer.ID follows tangents deliberately — the unexpected result from a search is often more valuable than the expected one. Archer.ID's search sessions are longer and less linear. This is correct behaviour for his function.

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
*(For Claude Code build — not agent-facing)*

**API:** Anthropic web search tool (available natively in Claude API) or Brave Search API as alternative.
**Rate limiting:** Log all searches to prevent redundant queries across agents in the same run.
**Caching:** Results cached in Aragorn for the session duration. Same query in the same session returns cached results unless FRESH flag is set.
**Cost tracking:** Each search call logged with approximate token cost. Fellowship of the Raf .MK1/Gandalf.ID monitors search volume per project run.

## RUFLO BRIDGE
*(Runtime implementation — not agent-facing)*

No swarm needed. Direct MCP tool invocation.

```bash
# Gandalf or agent dispatches via MCP
mcp__claude-flow__web_search({ query: "[search query]" })
```

Results written to Aragorn under the calling agent's key:
```bash
npx ruflo@alpha memory store --namespace aragorn --key "[agent]-search-$(date +%s)" --value "[search results summary]"
```

Legolas indexing: if search surfaces stable domain knowledge worth preserving, Gandalf flags it on session close for Legolas indexing via `memory store --namespace legolas`.
