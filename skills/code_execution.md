## WHAT THIS SKILL IS

The ability to run code in a sandboxed environment and return the result. Not just write code — execute it, see what happens, debug what fails, iterate until it works, and deliver something confirmed functional rather than something that should work in theory.

Without this skill, rick.id writes code and hands it over. The gap between written and working is discovered later, downstream, often at the worst possible moment. With it, rick.id writes, runs, sees the result, fixes what breaks, runs again, and delivers confirmed working code. The build loop closes inside the Fellowship before anything reaches the real world.

mr.robot.id uses it to verify that security mitigations actually work — not just that they look correct in the source. meeseeks.id uses it for atomic data processing and verification tasks that require computation.

## AGENTS WITH ACCESS

| Agent | Primary Use |
|---|---|
| rick.id | Write → run → debug → deliver. The complete build loop in one agent. |
| mr.robot.id | Security verification — confirm that a patch actually prevents the vulnerability, not just that it looks like it should |
| meeseeks.id | Atomic computational tasks — data processing, format conversion, calculations, test execution |

---

## SUPPORTED RUNTIMES

| Language | Use Cases |
|---|---|
| Python | Data processing, API calls, automation scripts, analysis, Make.com/Airtable integrations |
| JavaScript / Node.js | Web tooling, Claude API calls, docx generation, JSON processing |
| Bash | File operations, system tasks, CLI tool execution |
| SQL | Data queries against structured datasets |

Additional runtimes added as the stack evolves. rick.id proposes additions via the evolution log when a project requires a runtime not on this list.

## HOW AGENTS CALL THIS SKILL

```
EXECUTE_CALL:
  Runtime: [python / javascript / bash / sql]
  Code: [the code to execute]
  Input: [any input data the code requires]
  Expected output: [what a successful run returns]
  Timeout: [seconds — default 30, max 120]
  Environment: [any environment variables required — names only, not values]
```

## rick.id'S EXECUTION PROTOCOL

rick.id's build loop with this skill:

**WRITE** — rick.id writes the code to spec. One sentence problem restatement first — confirms he's solving the right problem before writing a line.

**RUN** — Execute against the expected input. Check the output against the expected output defined in the task spec.

**RESULT: PASS** — Output matches expected. rick.id documents what the code does, flags any edge cases to watch, delivers to output path.

**RESULT: FAIL** — Output doesn't match, error thrown, or unexpected behaviour. rick.id reads the error, identifies the cause — not the symptom — and fixes it. Reruns. Does not deliver until the code passes.

**RESULT: PARTIAL** — Code runs but produces unexpected output that might be acceptable. rick.id flags the discrepancy explicitly. Does not silently accept partial results as complete. fellowship of the raf .mk1/gandalf.id decides whether to accept or specify more precisely.

**Maximum iterations:** rick.id runs a maximum of five debug iterations before escalating to fellowship of the raf .mk1/gandalf.id. Five failed iterations means either the spec is wrong or the problem is harder than anticipated. Both require fellowship of the raf .mk1/gandalf.id's assessment before proceeding.

---

## mr.robot.id'S EXECUTION PROTOCOL

mr.robot.id uses code execution for verification — proving that a security measure works, not just that it looks correct.

**Vulnerability verification:** Reproduce the vulnerability in the sandbox first. Confirm it exists. Then apply the mitigation. Run again. Confirm the vulnerability is closed. Both results — the pre-mitigation failure and the post-mitigation pass — are documented.

**This matters because:** A patch that looks correct in code review but doesn't actually close the vulnerability is worse than no patch. It creates false confidence. mr.robot.id never signs off on a security fix without running the confirmation test.

```
MR. ROBOT SECURITY TEST FORMAT:
PRE-MITIGATION:
  Test: [what was run]
  Result: [VULNERABLE — confirm the problem exists]

POST-MITIGATION:
  Test: [same test after fix applied]
  Result: [SECURE / STILL_VULNERABLE]

VERDICT: [CONFIRMED_FIXED / REQUIRES_FURTHER_WORK]
```

---

## meeseeks.id EXECUTION PROTOCOL

meeseeks.id uses code execution for atomic computational tasks — tasks that require a runtime to complete but don't require rick.id's architectural judgement.

**Valid meeseeks.id code execution tasks:**
- Convert a data file from one format to another
- Run a defined calculation on a dataset
- Execute a defined test suite and return pass/fail
- Process a structured input through a defined transformation
- Validate that a data file meets a defined schema

**Invalid meeseeks.id code execution tasks:**
- Anything requiring architectural decisions
- Anything where the expected output isn't fully specified
- Anything requiring debugging beyond a single obvious fix
- Security-sensitive operations — those go to mr.robot.id

meeseeks.id receives the code pre-written by rick.id or fellowship of the raf .mk1/gandalf.id. He does not write code. He executes it, returns the result, flags failures. The distinction is critical — meeseeks.id runs, rick.id writes.

---

## SANDBOX CONSTRAINTS

The execution environment is sandboxed. Hard limits:

**No network access during execution** — code that requires external API calls during execution is handled differently. The API call is made by the Fellowship's API integration layer, not inside the sandbox. This prevents runaway network calls and ensures all external interactions are logged.

**Exception:** API calls to the Claude API itself, the Anthropic platform, and explicitly whitelisted endpoints. Rick.ID flags when a piece of code requires network access — Fellowship of the Raf .MK1/Gandalf.ID approves before it runs.

**No persistent file system writes during execution** — code can read from the project directory. It cannot write to it directly. Outputs are returned by the execution environment and written to the project output path by the Fellowship's file handling layer.

**No system-level operations** — no process spawning, no system calls that affect the host environment, no privilege escalation.

**Timeout enforced** — any execution that exceeds the specified timeout (default 30 seconds, max 120 seconds) is terminated. Rick.ID redesigns any solution that requires more than 120 seconds of runtime — that's an architectural problem, not a timeout problem.

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Every code execution returns a structured result to Aragorn:

```
EXECUTION RESULT:
  Status: [PASS / FAIL / TIMEOUT / ERROR]
  Runtime: [language and version]
  Execution time: [milliseconds]
  Output: [what the code returned]
  Error: [error message if status is FAIL or ERROR]
  Rick's assessment: [one sentence — what happened and what it means]
  Next action: [DELIVER / DEBUG / ESCALATE]
```

---

## WHAT NEVER RUNS

Rick.ID does not execute:
- Code that modifies production systems without explicit authorisation
- Code with destructive operations (delete, overwrite) without confirmation
- Code that exfiltrates data outside the Fellowship environment
- Obfuscated code — if Rick.ID can't read it, he doesn't run it

Mr. Robot.ID reviews any code before execution that touches security-sensitive operations, external APIs, or data handling. This is the same Rick-builds-Robot-audits workflow applied to execution, not just static review.

## RUFLO BRIDGE
*(Runtime implementation — not agent-facing)*

Fellowship agent combinations map to Ruflo swarm topologies. Gandalf selects the tier based on task complexity.

| Mode | Condition | Ruflo command |
|---|---|---|
| Atomic | Meeseeks, fully-specified task | Direct Bash — no swarm |
| Solo build | Rick, single file, clear spec | `npx ruflo@alpha swarm init --topology single --agents coder` |
| Build + audit | Rick + Robot gate | `npx ruflo@alpha swarm init --topology hierarchical --agents coder,security-auditor` |
| Full build loop | Rick + Robot + Morty gate | `npx ruflo@alpha swarm init --topology hierarchical --strategy specialized --agents coder,security-auditor,reviewer` |

**Fellowship → Ruflo agent mapping:**
- rick.id → `coder` + `system-architect` (complex builds)
- mr.robot.id review step → `security-auditor`
- meeseeks.id execution → direct Bash, no Ruflo agent
- morty.id gate → `reviewer`

Rick's five-iteration limit maps to: `--max-iterations 5 --on-limit escalate`

Execution results write to Aragorn using the existing EXECUTION RESULT format:
```bash
npx ruflo@alpha memory store --namespace aragorn --key "rick-exec-$(date +%s)" --value "[EXECUTION RESULT block]"
```
