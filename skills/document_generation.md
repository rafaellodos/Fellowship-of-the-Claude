# SKILL: DOCUMENT GENERATION
## Fellowship Skill — Formatted .docx Output
### Lives at: /fellowship/skills/document_generation.md
### Available to: Chinaski.ID (primary), Harvey.ID, Rick.ID, Fellowship of the Raf .MK1/Gandalf.ID

---

## WHAT THIS SKILL IS

The ability to produce a formatted, professional Word document (.docx) as a final deliverable — not markdown that gets copy-pasted somewhere else, but a document that goes directly to a client, a collaborator, or an archive without a manual production step.

This skill closes the last mile. Chinaski.ID writes. Harvey.ID produces strategy documents. Rick.ID produces technical specifications. Without this skill, every piece of output requires the operator to take the content and format it manually before it can leave the Fellowship. With it, the output is the deliverable.

## AGENTS WITH ACCESS

| Agent | Primary Output Type |
|---|---|
| Chinaski.ID | Brand copy, proposals, content pieces, essays, scripts formatted for delivery |
| Harvey.ID | Strategy documents, competitive analyses, positioning briefs, client-facing reports |
| Rick.ID | Technical specifications, architecture documents, build plans |
| Fellowship of the Raf .MK1/Gandalf.ID | Final project deliverables — the synthesised output of a full Fellowship run |

## DOCUMENT TYPES

Each document type has a defined template structure. Agents select the appropriate type when calling this skill.

### TYPE 1 — CLIENT PROPOSAL
For your consulting work and your primary business client-facing proposals.

```
Structure:
- Cover page (client name, project name, date, the operator's name/company)
- Executive Summary (1 page)
- The Situation (what we understand about the client's challenge)
- The Approach (what we propose to do)
- The Deliverables (what they receive)
- Investment (pricing — pulled from brief constraints)
- About (brief your consulting work/your primary business positioning)
- Next Steps
```

### TYPE 2 — STRATEGY DOCUMENT
For Harvey.ID's competitive and strategic outputs.

```
Structure:
- Title page
- Strategic Summary (the one-paragraph version of the whole document)
- Situation Analysis
- Key Findings
- Strategic Options (with tradeoffs)
- Recommendation
- Implementation Considerations
- Appendix (supporting data, research citations)
```

### TYPE 3 — CONTENT PIECE
For Chinaski.ID's long-form written output — essays, articles, scripts.

```
Structure:
- Title
- Body (Chinaski's content, formatted for readability)
- No imposed section structure — Chinaski's form governs
```

### TYPE 4 — TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION
For Rick.ID's build documents.

```
Structure:
- Title and version
- Overview (what this spec covers)
- Architecture (system design, component map)
- Technical Requirements
- Implementation Steps
- Testing Criteria
- Known Risks and Mitigations
```

### TYPE 5 — BRIEF / REPORT
For general purpose documents — meeting outputs, research summaries, internal briefs.

```
Structure:
- Title and date
- Summary
- Body sections (defined by content)
- Conclusions / Next Steps
```

## HOW AGENTS CALL THIS SKILL

```
DOCX_CALL:
  Type: [CLIENT_PROPOSAL / STRATEGY / CONTENT / TECHNICAL / BRIEF]
  Title: [document title]
  Author: [agent name — appears in document metadata]
  Content: [the full written content, section by section]
  Branding: [INSPIRACY / AVENOIRTECH / NEUTRAL]
  Recipient: [who this document is for — affects tone and cover page]
  Output path: /projects/[name]/outputs/[agent]/[filename].docx
```

## BRANDING PROFILES

**INSPIRACY**
- Colour palette: defined in /fellowship/skills/assets/inspiracy_brand.md
- Logo: /fellowship/skills/assets/inspiracy_logo.png
- Typography: brand fonts as defined
- Tone register: strategic, creative, confident

**AVENOIRTECH**
- Colour palette: defined in /fellowship/skills/assets/avenoirtech_brand.md
- Logo: /fellowship/skills/assets/avenoirtech_logo.png
- Typography: clean, modern, professional
- Tone register: operational, direct, technology-forward

**NEUTRAL**
- Clean white document, no branding
- Georgia or Arial typography
- Used for internal documents, personal writing, non-client outputs

*Brand asset files are populated when brand guidelines are defined. Until then, NEUTRAL is the default for all document types.*

## QUALITY STANDARDS

Every document produced by this skill must meet these standards before being written to the output path:

**Structural integrity** — all required sections present for the document type. No empty sections. A section that has no content is removed, not left blank.

**Consistency** — heading hierarchy consistent throughout. Formatting applied uniformly. No mixed styles within a document.

**Recipient-appropriate tone** — a document going to a small business client reads differently from one going to a corporate client. The agent specifies the recipient in the call. The document generation layer adjusts register accordingly.

**Length discipline** — documents are as long as they need to be. Not padded to look substantial. Not truncated to look efficient. The content determines the length. A strategy document that needs three pages does not become five because five feels more professional.

---

## CHINASKI-SPECIFIC USAGE

Chinaski.ID's output is voice-driven. The document generation skill must not sanitise that voice in the formatting process. When Chinaski.ID produces a content piece, the formatting layer's job is to present his words cleanly — not to impose corporate structure on material that has its own structure.

For Chinaski.ID outputs: TYPE 3 (CONTENT PIECE) always. No imposed section headers unless Chinaski.ID has written them. Typography and spacing that serves readability without imposing editorial voice.

---

## HARVEY-SPECIFIC USAGE

Harvey.ID's strategy documents are often time-sensitive — produced for a conversation happening soon, or a decision being made now. The document generation layer prioritises speed on Harvey.ID outputs. Clean over elaborate. Functional over beautiful. The intelligence in the document is the value, not the production quality.

For Harvey.ID outputs: TYPE 2 (STRATEGY) or TYPE 1 (CLIENT PROPOSAL). Branding applied from the relevant company profile. Delivered to the output path immediately on generation — no review queue.

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
*(For Claude Code build — not agent-facing)*

**Library:** docx npm package (already proven in this session's architecture document build).
**Template engine:** JavaScript template literals constructing docx Document objects. One template file per document type in /fellowship/skills/assets/templates/.
**Brand assets:** Logo files and colour palettes stored in /fellowship/skills/assets/. Referenced by branding profile name in the docx call.
**Output:** Written to specified output path as .docx. Confirmation written to Aragorn. File path returned to calling agent.
**Validation:** python validate.py run on every generated document before confirmation. Invalid documents flagged to Fellowship of the Raf .MK1/Gandalf.ID rather than silently delivered.
**Google Docs compatibility:** All documents generated with Google Docs compatibility in mind — DXA units for tables, no percentage widths, Arial fallback fonts.

## RUFLO BRIDGE
*(Runtime implementation — not agent-facing)*

No swarm needed for standard documents. Rick + Chinaski collaboration uses a minimal two-agent swarm for complex technical documents.

```bash
# Standard document — direct execution via Claude Code
# Rick or Chinaski produces the document per their task spec

# Technical document with narrative layer (Rick structure + Chinaski voice)
npx ruflo@alpha swarm init --topology hierarchical --agents coder,researcher
```

Output written to the project deliverables path: `/workspace/[workspace]/Projects/[project]/deliverables/`

Chinaski always retrieves Legolas voice context before generating documents:
```bash
npx ruflo@alpha memory search --namespace legolas --query "rafael voice [document type] [audience]" --top-k 3
```
