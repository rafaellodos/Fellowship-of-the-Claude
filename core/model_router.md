## WHAT THIS IS

A routing protocol Gandalf executes at dispatch time. Before any agent runs, Gandalf passes the task through this router and assigns a model tier. The tier goes into the task spec. The agent runs on the assigned tier. Gandalf can override — but the router sets the default and the override must be logged.

The goal: the right model for the actual task, not the most capable model by default. Frontier models are exceptional tools. Using them for classification, formatting, or simple drafting is waste — and waste compounds across a project run.

---

## THE THREE TIERS

```
FRONTIER   Claude Opus / GPT-4o
           Reserved for tasks where quality gap is real and consequential.
           Judgment under genuine uncertainty. High-stakes outputs.
           Client-facing documents where voice and precision both matter.
           Cost: highest. Use deliberately.

MID        Claude Sonnet
           The workhorse. Most fellowship tasks land here.
           Competent reasoning, good output quality, fast enough.
           Default when no signal pushes toward Frontier or Fast.
           Cost: moderate. Use as the baseline assumption.

FAST       Claude Haiku / GPT-3.5
           Classification, extraction, formatting, routing decisions themselves.
           Tasks with fully specified outputs where reasoning depth is irrelevant.
           Meeseeks atomic tasks when the spec is tight.
           Cost: lowest. Use whenever the task genuinely permits it.
```

## THE ROUTING SEQUENCE

Gandalf runs four layers in order. Each layer can push the tier up or down. The output of all four is the final tier assignment.

```
LAYER 1 → Category baseline
LAYER 2 → Signal adjustments
LAYER 3 → Complexity score
LAYER 4 → Cost cap check

Final tier = result after all four layers
```

---

## LAYER 1 — CATEGORY BASELINE

Every task belongs to a primary category. The category sets the starting tier before any other assessment.

|Category|Definition|Baseline tier|
|---|---|---|
|CLASSIFY|Sort, tag, route, extract structured data from clear input|FAST|
|RESEARCH|Find, compile, synthesise information to a defined brief|MID|
|WRITE|Produce written output — copy, content, documents, comms|MID|
|BUILD|Code, architecture, technical configuration|MID|
|AUDIT|Security review, ethics review, legal scan, quality check|MID|
|REASON|Strategic analysis, competitive assessment, planning|FRONTIER|
|INTERROGATE|Philosophical interrogation, assumption stress-testing|FRONTIER|
|SYNTHESISE|Multi-source synthesis into a final deliverable|FRONTIER|

If a task spans multiple categories, use the highest baseline tier present.

---

## LAYER 2 — SIGNAL CHECKLIST

After the category baseline, Gandalf checks each signal below. Signals push the tier up (+1) or down (-1) relative to current position. Tier cannot go above FRONTIER or below FAST.

**Signals that push UP (+1 tier):**

```
[ ] Output is client-facing
    A document, email, or deliverable going directly to the operator's client.
    Errors are reputational. Voice must be right.

[ ] Output is irreversible
    Once sent, published, or deployed, mistakes cannot be easily corrected.
    Raise the capability floor.

[ ] Genuine ambiguity in the task
    The task spec leaves real judgment calls that require reasoning,
    not just execution. The agent needs to decide, not just do.

[ ] Multiple constraints to hold simultaneously
    More than three non-trivial constraints that must all be satisfied.
    Complexity compounds — raise the tier.

[ ] High-stakes decision
    Output will materially affect the operator's business, finances,
    or reputation. Morty has already flagged this as consequential.

[ ] First time this task type has been run
    No prior Frodo record to draw from. The agent is working without
    the benefit of pattern recognition on this specific task type.
```

**Signals that push DOWN (-1 tier):**

```
[ ] Fully specified output format
    The output format is defined precisely. No judgment about
    structure, length, or form required. Execution only.

[ ] High repetition / established pattern
    Frodo contains multiple successful prior examples of this
    exact task type. The agent is following a proven pattern.

[ ] Internal only
    Output never leaves the fellowship. Errors are recoverable.
    No client or reputational exposure.

[ ] Single constraint
    One thing to get right. No competing considerations.

[ ] Reversible output
    Easy to redo if wrong. Low cost of failure.
```

**Apply all signals. Net adjustment determines tier shift.** Two up-signals and one down-signal = net +1 from baseline. More than three net up-signals from a MID baseline = FRONTIER regardless of individual count. More than two net down-signals from a MID baseline = FAST regardless of individual count.

---

## LAYER 3 — COMPLEXITY SCORE

After category and signals, Gandalf assigns an explicit complexity score from 1–10. This is a judgment call, not a formula. The category and signals inform it. The score determines the final tier if signals produced an ambiguous result.

```
COMPLEXITY SCALE:

1–3   FAST territory
      Fully specified. Single output. No reasoning required.
      Example: "Extract all email addresses from this document."
      Example: "Tag each of these 20 items as client / prospect / other."

4–6   MID territory
      Clear task, some reasoning required, defined but not rigid output.
      Example: "Summarise this competitive landscape in 500 words."
      Example: "Draft a follow-up email to this client based on the CRM log."
      Example: "Write three positioning statements for your primary business."

7–8   FRONTIER territory
      Genuine judgment required. Multiple competing considerations.
      High-quality output matters. Client-facing or consequential.
      Example: "Produce a full competitive intelligence report on this market."
      Example: "Write the strategy document for this client engagement."
      Example: "Interrogate the assumptions in this project plan."

9–10  FRONTIER — no override possible
      Maximum stakes. Irreversible. Client-facing. Novel situation.
      Example: "Draft the proposal for this £50k engagement."
      Example: "Produce the final deliverable for this client."
      Example: "Assess whether to proceed with this partnership."
```

**Score-to-tier mapping:**

- Score 1–3 → FAST (unless signals pushed above)
- Score 4–6 → MID (unless signals adjusted)
- Score 7–10 → FRONTIER

**Conflict resolution:** If the complexity score and the signal-adjusted tier disagree, the higher of the two wins. Never downgrade a high-complexity-score task because signals pushed it down. The score is the floor.

---

## LAYER 4 — COST CAP CHECK

Every project has an optional cost cap. When set, Layer 4 checks whether the current tier assignment fits within the remaining budget.

**Cost cap is set in the project brief or by Gandalf at planning.** Default: no cap — route on quality. When set: expressed as a tier ceiling for the project. "MID maximum" means no FRONTIER tasks unless Gandalf explicitly overrides.

**Cost cap behaviour:**

```
If no cap is set:
  → Final tier from Layers 1–3 stands. No adjustment.

If cap is set and tier is within cap:
  → Final tier stands.

If cap is set and tier exceeds cap:
  → Downgrade to cap tier.
  → LOG the downgrade in Aragorn: which task, what tier was assigned,
    what tier was forced by cap, what quality risk this introduces.
  → If task scored 9–10 on complexity: do not downgrade.
    Escalate to the operator instead. Some tasks cannot be cost-capped
    without unacceptable quality risk. the operator decides.
```

**Project budget tracking:** Gandalf maintains a running count of model tier deployments in Aragorn during each project run. Format:

```
MODEL USAGE — [project name]
  Frontier calls: [n]
  Mid calls: [n]
  Fast calls: [n]
  Estimated cost: [calculated at session close]
  Cap status: [within / approaching / at limit]
```

This surfaces in the structured reflection. Over time, the operator can see where cost is concentrated and where routing decisions were correct or incorrect.

## AGENT HARD FLOORS AND CEILINGS

Some agents have routing constraints that override the router output. These are non-negotiable — they are part of the agent's identity and purpose.

|Agent|Floor|Ceiling|Reason|
|---|---|---|---|
|Gandalf|FRONTIER|—|Orchestration quality determines everything downstream. Never compromise here.|
|Socrates|FRONTIER|—|Philosophical depth is the function. A cheaper Socrates is not Socrates.|
|Rick|MID|—|Technical build quality. Fast is insufficient for architecture and code.|
|Mr. Robot|FRONTIER|—|Security reasoning requires adversarial depth. Fast models miss edge cases that matter.|
|Chinaski|MID|—|Voice fidelity requires sufficient model capability. Fast cannot hold register.|
|Harvey|MID|—|Strategic reasoning floor. Fast is insufficient for competitive analysis.|
|Morty|MID|—|Ethics reasoning requires consistency. Fast introduces unreliable judgment.|
|Archer|MID|—|Pattern recognition across domains needs sufficient reasoning capacity.|
|Merry|FAST|MID|Classification and routing. Rarely needs above Fast.|
|Pippin|FAST|MID|Ingestion and parsing. Complex documents push to Mid.|
|Meeseeks|FAST|MID|Atomic execution. Fully specified tasks run Fast. Complex specs push to Mid.|

**How floors and ceilings interact with the router:** If the router assigns FAST to Rick → floor overrides → MID assigned, downgrade logged. If the router assigns FRONTIER to Merry → ceiling overrides → MID assigned, upgrade logged. Logging both directions ensures Gandalf can see where the router and the agent constraints diverge frequently — that pattern may indicate a calibration update is needed.

---

## DISPATCH SPEC FORMAT

After routing, Gandalf includes the model assignment in every dispatch spec. Model names are looked up in `/core/model_registry.md` — the router outputs a tier, the registry resolves it to the current environment's specific model.

```
DISPATCH:
  Agent: [name]
  Task: [description]
  Workspace slices: [list]
  Active skills: [list]
  Task spec: [full atomic spec]

  MODEL ROUTING:
    Category: [CLASSIFY / RESEARCH / WRITE / BUILD / AUDIT / REASON / INTERROGATE / SYNTHESISE]
    Signals raised: [list of signals that fired, up or down]
    Complexity score: [1–10]
    Router output: [FAST / MID / FRONTIER]
    Floor/ceiling applied: [YES — [agent] floor/ceiling → [final tier] / NO]
    Cost cap applied: [YES — downgraded from [tier] / NO]
    Final tier: [FAST / MID / FRONTIER]
    Override: [NONE / Gandalf override — reason: ...]
```

The routing record is in Aragorn for the session and flushes to Frodo at close. Over time this builds a calibration dataset — which tasks were routed to which tier, whether the output quality matched the tier assignment.

---

## GANDALF OVERRIDE PROTOCOL

Gandalf can override the router output. The override must be logged. No silent overrides.

**Valid override reasons:**

- "Task is novel — elevating to Frontier despite low score because no prior pattern exists"
- "Cost cap would degrade a client-facing deliverable — escalating to the operator rather than downgrading"
- "Agent floor conflict resolved — Mid assigned despite router Fast output"
- "the operator explicitly requested Frontier for this task"

**Invalid override reasons:**

- Habit ("we always use Frontier for Harvey")
- Assumption ("this feels important")
- Convenience ("faster to just use Frontier than to assess")

The override log becomes calibration data. If Gandalf regularly overrides the router in a particular direction for a particular agent or task type, the router defaults for that category need updating.

---

## CALIBRATION OVER TIME

The router improves through use. Monthly reflection includes a model routing review:

```
ROUTING REVIEW — [month]
  Tasks routed to Frontier: [n] — quality justified: [n] / over-specified: [n]
  Tasks routed to Mid: [n] — quality justified: [n] / under-specified: [n]
  Tasks routed to Fast: [n] — quality justified: [n] / under-specified: [n]
  Most common override direction: [up / down / none]
  Category most frequently over-routed: [category]
  Category most frequently under-routed: [category]
  Recommended calibration updates: [list]
```

Over-routing (assigning Frontier when Mid was sufficient) is waste. Under-routing (assigning Fast when Mid or Frontier was needed) is quality risk. Both are visible in the monthly review. Both get corrected.

  Apply if set and tier exceeds cap
  Do not apply if complexity score 9–10 — escalate instead
  Log if applied
